# WFE-STL-thumbnail-Provider-and-STL-ViewerFile


This is a Widondows File Explorer Shell Extension Thumbnail Provider.
It creates thumbnails for STL files in Windows File Explorer and other Windows programs that uses file-explorer.

The STL viewer is a small program that lets you twist-and-turn an STL-file without having to start a much bigger program.

Installation is done with an MSI

After installation the WFE Shell extension thumbnail provider must be registered and some trick must be done to recreate thumbnails for all files. This may take some time before all STL files get their thumbnails.

There is till a problem with "Whitewalkers". The STL might become white. This is because "Winter is comming" and the Software is written in Sweden ;-)

The more scientific reson for this is within the STL itself. The STL contains instructions that the STL should be white and that overrides the choice of color.
